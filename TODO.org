* Action Plan
** TODO running =list= subcommand through =head= results in a ~broken pipe~ error
** TODO write examples and API documentation
** TODO file bugs on github for anything remaining in this todo and delete this file
** nice-to-have: save and restore file metadata if option is given
*** do not do this by default, as it almost certainly would not work anyway
*** if ~itempos~ is non-zero, file metadata should not be serialized to the block
** nice-to-have: add files to an existing archive
*** must build up mapping of full paths to parent rowid
*** must determine the highest directory identifier so far
*** if adding a file in a new directory, add dir entry with highest id + 1
*** if adding a file to an existing directory, use that dir id as the parent
** nice-to-have: usage errors should be displayed nicely
*** not providing a password when one is required
*** providing the wrong password
** nice-to-have: include/exclude filters for create, list, and extract operations
** nice-to-have: option to add ~associated data~ when encrypting file with AEAD
** nice-to-have: check if compressed block is smaller, otherwise keep original data
** nice-to-have: sort incoming files by type (image vs text) to afford better compression
*** if files of a similar nature are grouped together, compression should yield better results
** nice-to-have: retain extended file attributes
*** need to record the names and raw values in some form of map
